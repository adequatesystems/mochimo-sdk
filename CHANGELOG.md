# Changelog

All notable changes to the Mochimo Node.js SDK will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.1] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- Introduced `getNetworkDsaHash()` for disaster recovery, returning the network-reported DSA hash so exchanges can validate the latest spend index before deriving a replacement keypair.

### Changed
- Updated `examples/exchange/5-recover-spend-index.js` to walk through a real-world recovery flow powered by `getNetworkDsaHash()`.
- Refreshed `README.md` and `examples/exchange/EXCHANGE_INTEGRATION.md` with guidance on when and how to call the new helper during incident response.

### Testing
- Bumped the CI workflow expectation from 46 to 77 unit tests and confirmed the full suite passes.
- Manually verified the recovery workflow against Mochimo mainnet transactions.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-25

### Changed
- Replaced the SHA-256 loop used for indexed key derivation with direct index-based derivation so generating the *n*-th keypair is now an `O(1)` operation rather than `O(n)`.
- Updated `generateAccountKeypair()` to honor the `index` option by folding it into the deterministic seed material before key generation.
- Synced deterministic derivation unit tests with the new index-driven logic to guard against regressions.

### Notes
- This release rolls forward every feature, documentation update, and CI improvement that previously lived in the unreleased `1.2.0` draft. If you were tracking that preview, you now get those changes on the supported `2.x` line.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- Exported the new `deconstructBase58Tag()` helper alongside existing Base58 utilities to expose checksum metadata to consumers.
- Introduced `npm run check:exports` for quick local verification that key SDK functions are exposed from the root module.

### Changed
- `base58ToAddrTag()` now reuses `deconstructBase58Tag()` and throws on checksum failures; `validateBase58Tag()` delegates to the same helper for consistent parsing.
- Updated the `VERSION` constant to read directly from `package.json`, keeping runtime metadata aligned with published releases.
- Refreshed the `examples/reference/send-transaction.js` script to consume the Base58 helpers from the main `mochimo` entry point.

### Fixed
- Ensured Base58 utilities are available via `import { base58ToAddrTag } from 'mochimo'` without relying on deep import paths.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-19
